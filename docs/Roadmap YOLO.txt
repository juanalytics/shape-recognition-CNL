Go for Pretrained YOLO + OpenCV if you want a quick and effective solution without much training.
Only train YOLO from scratch if OpenCV struggles to classify shapes or if the pretrained YOLO model does not generalize well.

CONDA: 
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate yolo-env
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

Your GTX 1050 Ti (4GB VRAM) has limited memory, so:
Recommended batch size: 8 - 16
‚úÖ Start with batch size = 8, increase only if training runs without crashing..

üîç YOLOv8n has 225 layers.
We are going to train only in the neck and head layers
so we are fixing the first 50 layers

saving different versions of your .pt file is crucial because:
‚úÖ It allows rollback if the latest model is worse.
‚úÖ You can compare different training runs to find the best model.
‚úÖ If the training process fails or gets interrupted, you don‚Äôt lose progress.

How to Save Different Versions?
Automatically save the best model during training:
model.train(data="shapes.yaml", epochs=50, batch=8, imgsz=640, save=True)
